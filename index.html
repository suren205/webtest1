	<dt> Computer </dt>
    <dd> A computer is an electronic device that processes and manipulates data according to a set of instructions or programs. It can perform calculations, store information, retrieve data, and execute complex algorithms to solve problems. Modern computers typically consist of hardware (physical components like the processor, memory, and storage) and software (programs and operating systems that manage tasks).

    <dt> Artificial Inteligence </dt>
    <dd> Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think, learn, reason, and solve problems in a manner similar to humans. AI enables computers and systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

	<dt> Mechine Learning </dt>
    <dd> Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to learn from and make decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed for each specific task. In essence, ML enables systems to improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.
